  ### Note to Grader: 
  5/21: 
  - When I run the script, the licenses are considered as "Undefined". Also this might just be on the VSCode portion, but whenever I open the README.md file the content inside is different
  to when I preview the README.md
  - The recording is inside the utils folder but the link doesn't seem to work and I am not sure how to fix it.
